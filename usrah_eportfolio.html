      <h2>Task 1: Group Assignment – Role Play</h2>
      <p>In this task, our group was required to role-play the correct behavior when seeking knowledge.
      My role was to advise friends by using relevant Hadith and Quranic verses to remind them about the proper manners of a student.
      Through this role play, we highlighted important values such as respecting the teacher, sincerity in seeking knowledge, and practicing what is learned.
      This activity helped me to understand that knowledge should be sought with humility and good manners, as guided in Islam.</p>

      <h2>Task 2: Reflection on Correct Behavior in Seeking Knowledge</h2>
      <p>This portfolio itself serves as Task 2, where I explain in detail the correct behavior when seeking knowledge.</p>
      <h3>Correct Behavior in Seeking Knowledge (Adab al-Talib al-‘Ilm)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sincerity (Ikhlas)</strong> – Seek knowledge for Allah’s sake, not for fame or worldly gain.<br>
          <em>Quran:</em> “And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, [being] sincere to Him in religion…” (Surah Al-Bayyina, 98:5)</li>
        <li><strong>Respecting Teachers and Knowledge</strong> – Show humility towards teachers and value the knowledge they share.<br>
          <em>Hadith:</em> “He is not of us who does not have mercy on young children, nor honor the elderly, nor acknowledge the right of the scholar.” (Ahmad, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi)</li>
        <li><strong>Acting Upon Knowledge</strong> – Practice what is learned.<br>
          <em>Quran:</em> “Do you enjoin righteousness upon the people while you forget yourselves, although you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?” (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:44)</li>
        <li><strong>Being Patient and Consistent</strong> – Knowledge requires time, patience, and discipline.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of the Usrah Program</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Strengthens the bond of ukhuwah (brotherhood) among Muslim students.</li>
        <li>Encourages us to advise one another with Quran and Sunnah.</li>
        <li>Increases our faith (iman) and strengthens our path in Islam.</li>
        <li>Provides an environment of mutual respect and learning.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="white-section">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>From this assignment, I learned that seeking knowledge is an act of worship when done sincerely. By role-playing and reflecting, I realized that proper manners in learning are as important as the knowledge itself. The Usrah program reminded me that true knowledge brings humility, faith, and stronger bonds among Muslims.</p>
